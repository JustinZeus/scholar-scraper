# Scholar Scrape Probe (Temporary)

Purpose: short-lived workspace for information gathering and planning.

Rules:
- No production code changes here.
- Use this for HTML samples, parsing experiments, and extraction notes.
- Delete this directory after we lock the scrape contract and parser plan.

Structure:
- `fixtures/` saved HTML samples for parser validation
- `notes/` extraction decisions, edge cases, and risk log
- `scripts/` one-off probe scripts used only during planning
